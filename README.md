# chickenfight-game

**WORK** - Will always result in a positive money gain, but a small one. Also takes longer time to regenerate. 

**CRIME** - High risk, high reward

**PICK UP COIN FROM THE GROUND** - Pretty self explanatory

**UPGRADE** - Buy this upgrade to make your chickens produce 10% coins per sec based on their own amount. (100 chickens = 10 coins per sec)

Buy a chicken for 50 coins, and bet a minimum of 50 coins with the bet slider. Double your money or lose them. Be the richest chicken mogul around!

**Notes for future releases and known bugs:**

 - Add possibility of bank loans and ability to lose the game if the interest rate exceeds the income amount of chickens
- Make the save button functional
- Add high-scores
- More upgrades
- Slow down the animations
- Fix a bug where the slider fills and empties itself if you got a negative amount of money and generate a plus amount of coins
- Add animation to the fight with chickens
- Add soundtrack and other interactive sounds
- Add background and a welcome screen
- Fix a bug where crime win/loss is displayed with decimals
