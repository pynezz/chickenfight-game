# chickenfight-game

**WORK** - Will always result in a positive money gain, but a small one. Also takes longer time to regenerate. 

**CRIME** - High risk, high reward

**PICK UP COIN FROM THE GROUND** - Pretty self explanatory

**MARKETPLACE** - Buy armored chickens, bribe the judge + level dependent unlocks
